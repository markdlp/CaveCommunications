	abstract = {Wireless underground sensor networks are the new area of research. It is widely used in many engineering applications, from smart irrigation to security and precision agriculture. Some of the application areas of wireless underground sensor networks are underground with space, such as tunnel, cave, and so on, while some consist of no spaced underground solid areas as well. In this context, wireless underground sensor networks have recently become very important for precision agriculture purposes. In this paper, a smart insect pest detection technique with qualified underground wireless sensor nodes for precision agriculture has been investigated with a mathematical simulation model. In a simulated smart technique, insect pest detection is assumed to be carried out with a qualified acoustic sensor. In order to evaluate the performance of the underground network structure, the received signal strength and path loss parameters are examined. As the depth distance increases, the increase in path loss of communication has been revealed. The obtained performance evaluation result reveals the need for signal transmission with different transmitter power for depth-based communication in wireless underground sensor networks.},

	abstract = {Improvements in underground wireless tracking technology are critical for improved safety and productivity in underground mines. While the recent focus on technology development has been for underground coal mines, improvements are required for block caving operations which have very different characteristics from coal mines. Block caving is characterized by a large number of draw points from which the mineral ore is extracted from under the ore body, and efficient and safe operation of such a mine requires careful monitoring and control of the distribution of ore extraction from the draw points. In this paper a new algorithm is presented for accurately tracking mine vehicles in an underground mine with a low density of reference nodes. A system is described that was installed at an operation mine, and results from a year long trial are presented. The results showed that the system is capable of accurately tracking ore extraction in an operational mine, and of reliable operation over an extended period of time.},

	abstract = {Lava tubes are thought to exist on Mars and on the Moon, and are of special interest for science objectives and human habitability. The communications environment in such a cave is important for exploration. This paper explores the use of the shooting and bouncing rays ({SBR}) approximation to modeling the electromagnetics environment in a basalt rock lava tube with an obstruction, such as a cave-in. The cave, which has smooth walls, widens until the obstruction occurs, and then narrows. There is no line-of-sight communications path. A cave length of 100 meters is modeled. Existing knowledge of tunnel communications and the {ANSYS} Savant tool are leveraged in order to provide results for the cave geometry. A number of observations are offered in the following areas based on indications obtained from lava tube modeling: (1) Enhanced signals are observed. This is the degree to which the cave walls can create an amplification of the received signal and assist communications by reflecting the incident and re-scattered signals. Communications behind the obstacle is possible. (2) Spatial signal fading was observed, hinting at geometric effects or that scattered signals can combine destructively. Deep fades occur but appear to be rare. (3) Diminished signal strength occurs at the boundaries. Robotic exploration may take place close to the cave floor or walls. Indications from simulation for signal strengths close to the cave floor and walls are examined. (4) Frequency-selective fading can occur. The time-delay spread is discussed. The simulation results include an evaluation of {IEEE} 802.11 {WiFi} at 2.4 {GHz} using a freestanding electric cross dipole antenna and transmitted signal powers from 10mW to 100mW. Receive data rates are derived at locations throughout the cave and are provided to the degree that the cave geometry and electromagnetics approximations hold. These are only estimates of actual data rates subject to the approximations that were applied. Simplifications and adaptations of the {WiFi} waveform are discussed as part of a power trade.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Wireless communication systems can be found in a wide variety of environments such as industrial, scientific, home and building automation, vehicles and outdoor environments, mainly due to the development of smaller and cheaper devices and the increasing operational lifetime. In this paper, the feasibility of the deployment of a wireless communication system inside caves is presented. Specifically, a Wireless Sensor Network ({WSN}) at 868 {MHz}, 2.4 {GHz} and 5 {GHz} bands is studied. {WSN} in cave environments have great potential because communication systems for speleology and potholing are wired, including the systems used by emergency and rescue teams such as firefighters. In order to perform the radio propagation analysis, an in-house 3D Ray Launching simulation code has been employed, which provides accurate estimations of received power level for full complex indoor scenarios, as it takes into account the topology and the morphology of the scenario, including material properties. Fig. 1a shows the schematic representation of the considered scenario for this work, which corresponds to the dimensions of a real cave placed in Navarre. The estimated received power level for a height of 1.5m inside the cave is represented in Fig. 1b. Results confirm that there is a great dependence of network performance with the topology of the scenario. Therefore, an overall increase system efficiency can be achieved with the aid of this deterministic simulation method.},

	shorttitle = {Fifth Generation Cellular Networks for Underground Block Cave Mining},
	abstract = {In this position paper we put forward the case for the fifth generation of cellular networks (5G) to be the successor for {WiFi} in underground mining. 5G promises increases in bit rates, a redesign of the Radio Access Network, low energy consumption for sensor communications and very low latencies. These make it a potentially attractive technology for underground mining, particularly Block Cave mining. Block Cave mining is a large scale form of underground mining. The communications needs of Block Cave mining span a wide range of data rates, latency requirements and distances. Underground mining is becoming more automated requiring increasingly more sophisticated communications technologies able to transmit high volumes of data quickly. It is also becoming more reliant on sensor technologies which, although generating little traffic, must survive using battery power for very long periods of time. 5G is a suitable technology for this wide range of applications. In the past the very great expense associated with base station deployment and maintenance has limited cellular use underground. However, the 5G Radio Access Network has been completely redesigned making 5G cellular a potentially more economic proposition than previous cellular generations. 5G also makes available very large amounts of bandwidth which potentially makes possible increased use of video and highly accurate and quick localisation underground. This paper provides an overview of 5G and then summarises the processes involved in Block Cave mining and the challenges the environment presents for communications technologies. The paper then shows how 5G can meet the requirements of underground mining and how the redesign of the Radio Access Network make 5G cellular networking a much more economical proposition than previous generations.},

	abstract = {Lava caves are the result of a geological process related to the cooling of basaltic lava flows. On the Moon, this process may lead to caves several kilometers long and diameters of hundreds of meters. Access to lava tubes can be granted through skylights, a vertical pit between the lava tube and the lunar surface. This represents an outstanding opportunity for long-term missions, for future permanent human settlements, and for accessing pristine samples of lava, secondary minerals and volatiles. Given this, the {ESA} launched a campaign through the Open Space Innovation Platform calling for ideas that would tackle the many challenges of exploring lava pits. Five projects, including Robocrane, were selected. Solar light and direct line of sight (for communications) with the lunar surface are not available inside lava tubes. This is a problem for any robot (or swarm of robots) exploring the lava tubes. Robocrane tackles both problems by deploying an element (called the Charging head, or {CH}) at the bottom of the skylight by means of a crane. This {CH} behaves as a battery charger and a communication relay for the exploring robots. The required energy is extracted from the crane‚Äôs solar panel (on the surface) and driven to the bottom of the skylight through an electrical wire running in parallel to the crane hoisting wire. Using a crane allows the system to deal with unstable terrain around the skylight rim and protect the wires from abrasion from the rocky surface and the pit rim. The charger in the {CH} is wireless so that the charging process can begin as soon as any of the robots get close enough to the {CH}. This avoids complex and time-consuming docking operations, aggravated by the skylight floor orography. The crane infrastructure can also be used to deploy the exploring robots inside the pit, reducing their design constraints and mass budget, as the robots do not need to implement their own self-deployment system. Finally, {RoboCrane} includes all the sensors and actuators for remote operation from a ground station. {RoboCrane} has been designed in a parametric tool so it can be dynamically and rapidly adjusted to input-variable changes, such as the number of exploring robots, their electrical characteristics, and crane reach, etc.},

This paper proposes the use of rotating permanently polarized dipoles (magnets or electrets) for such applications. A power-efficient data modulation scheme based on continuous-frequency {FSK} ({CF}-{FSK}) is also proposed for such electro-mechanical transmitters. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that 7-ary {CF}-{FSK} is optimal in the sense that it minimizes average mechanical torque on the mechatronic antenna for a given bit rate. Preliminary experimental results from a prototype {ELF} magnetic-field based transmitter based on a high-strength rare-earth ({NdFeB}) magnet and small brushless {DC} ({BLDC}) motor are presented. The results highlight local environment challenges such as power line interference that affect the choice of data encoding and modulation schemes. Reliable non-line-of-sight ({NLOS}) communication through concrete barriers at 100 Hz and 0.25 bit/sec is demonstrated at distances up to 5 m. The proposed mechatronic antenna and modulation scheme can be scaled up in both frequency and transmit power for more challenging applications in surface-to-undersea, surface-to-cave, and other conductive environments that require {ELF} channels.},

Motivated by the needs of first responders and military personnel arriving to an incident area, we developed and tested an automated deployment algorithm that indicates when a mesh node needs to be deployed as the coverage area grows. Conventional radios can experience severe coverage limitations inside structures such as hi-rise buildings, subterranean buildings, caves, and underground mines. The approach examined here is to deploy wireless relays that extend coverage through multihop communication using a deployment algorithm that employs physical layer measurements. A flexible platform based on {IEEE} 802.11 radios has been implemented and tested in a subterranean laboratory complex where conventional public safety radios have no coverage. Applications tested include two-way voice, data, and location information. This paper describes the testbed, presents experimental results, and recommends areas for further study and development in rapidly-deployable multihop networks.},

	abstract = {There are fundamentally two different communication media in wireless underground sensor networks. The first of these is a solid medium where the sensor nodes are buried underground and wirelessly transmit data from underground to aboveground. The second is an underground medium such as tunnel, cave etc. and the data is transmitted from underground to the aboveground through partially solid medium. The quality of communication is greatly influenced by the humidity of the soil in both environments. The placement of wireless underground sensor nodes at hard-to-reach locations makes energy efficient work compulsory. In this paper, rule based collector station selection scheme is proposed for lossless data transmission in underground sensor networks. In order for sensor nodes to transmit energy-efficient lossless data, rule-based selection operations are carried out with the help of fuzzy logic. The proposed wireless underground sensor network is simulated using Riverbed software, and fuzzy logic-based selection scheme is implemented utilizing Matlab software. In order to evaluate the performance of the sensor network; the parameters of delay, throughput and energy consumption are investigated. Examining performance evaluation results, it is seen that average delay and maximum throughput are accomplished in the proposed underground sensor network. Under these conditions, it has been shown that the most appropriate collector station selection decision is made with the aim of minimizing energy consumption.},

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of human interaction with the underground space, the observation of underground environment (e.g. soil moisture) and underground infrastructure (e.g. underground pipelines), as well as the monitoring and prevention of geological disasters (e.g., landslide and urban sinkholes) has attracted increasing attention and become a research focus. However, most of the traditional observation technologies are still facing difficulties in dynamic and continuous in-situ observations/monitoring within the complex underground environment. To solve this problem, this study adopts {LoRaWAN}-based wireless underground sensor networks ({WUSNS}) to monitor the underground environment or infrastructure. Furthermore, the feasibility of {LoRaWAN}-based {WUSNs} for underground monitoring is systematically demonstrated and presented in this article. Based on our recent validation of {LoRa}-based underground point-to-point channel model, we evaluate its network-level performance in this paper. We firstly develop a network simulator of {LoRaWAN}-based {WUSNs} to provide the feasibility analysis and experimental guidance for underground monitoring. Using this simulator, we numerically demonstrate that the {LoRaWAN}-based {WUSNs} technology is capable of underground monitoring over a large area and at great depths. We further certify that an appropriate selection of the physical layer parameters in various underground conditions is beneficial for underground observation. Finally, the balance between data receiver rate and network energy consumption can be implemented using different physical layer parameters for various underground monitoring applications. These results successfully demonstrate the efficient protocol development of {LoRaWAN}-based {WUSNs} and their applicability for underground monitoring applications.},

For wideband beamforming, taps have to be added to the full-band {ABA} for efficient suppression of the interference. However, the introduction of multiple taps results in the addition of uncorrelated noise to the {ABA}. This results in power loss in the direction perpendicular to the {ABA}. In order to compensate for the loss introduced by the addition of taps, the proposed concept is investigated. This configuration shows improved signal gain and deep suppression of the interference in the direction perpendicular to the {ABA}.},
